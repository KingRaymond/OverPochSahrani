This is my first attempt at the 3D editor. 

**Tools used**: 

Arma 2 3D editor
http://plugish.com/x.html(to create the biedi file for the existing banks.sqf)
NotePad++ (fine tweak the final result to my liking)
 
**Credits (as this is what I am using)**: 

Zupa for the original script which included the actual area for banking
mgm for the idea / instructions for banker NPCs
Soul for the 2.0 extension
 
**Installation instructions**: (Please make sure you backup all files you replace - just in case)
 
*Server PBO* ->

Copy banks.sqf in to dayz_server\bankzones\ - overwrite the current banks.sqf

*Mission PBO* -> 

Copy addbankmarkers.sqf in to DayZ_Epoch_22.smd_sahrani_A2\gold\  - overwrite the current addbankmarkers.sqf

Complete - very easy :)
